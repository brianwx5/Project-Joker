# Project-Joker

## Requirement
* Yelp API
* Leaflet
* Chat Box (2.0 feature)
## Use Case 
Imagine you are with your friends or significant other. Now, imagine someone recommending to eat out, but no one really knows what they want to eat. This is a common dilemma and there hasn't been any apps that could help with this problem. Facebook has suggestions, but you don't have the time to wait for a response that will possibly never come. 
## Information
This project is a mobile application that will resolve this issue and is similar to Yelp. The main difference between the two is a random generator that chooses the type of cuisine and a random restaurant within that category. Additional features such as a live chat will be implemented later, which is a better alternative to Facbook suggestions.
## Minimum Viable Product
This will at the very least provide you with a rando mrestaurant within the given distance that you provide in your settings.
